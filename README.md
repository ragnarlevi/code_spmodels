# code_spmodels

The code requires the package [tidyverse]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to be installed: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Please run `SimulationStudy.R` to run the simulation experiments. All models are contained in `utils_final.R`.

The output is in `simulation_final.RData` which can be loaded using `load("simulation_final.RData")`
